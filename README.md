# Discord-mention-rager-bot
A Discord bot that sends an angry message every time someone mentions @everyone

If you want to run this bot yourself you need to create a bot in the discord developers portal to get the bot token, then create token.txt in the same directory as mentionrager.py and put the token there with exactly one line and no whitespace.


Yes, Asoina, I created this in python just to spite you, deal with it
